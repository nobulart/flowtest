Certainly! Below is an example of how you can write `pytest` tests for a Flask API with a `/hello` endpoint that returns `'Hello, World!'` as JSON. We'll use `pytest` fixtures to create a test client and include a test for the endpoint's response.

First, let's assume your Flask application is in a file named `app.py`:

```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET'])
def hello():
    return jsonify(message='Hello, World!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Now, create a test file named `test_app.py`:

```python
# test_app.py

import pytest
from app import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    app.config['TESTING'] = True
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_hello_endpoint(client):
    response = client.get('/hello')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json == {'message': 'Hello, World!'}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`app.py`**: This is your Flask application with a `/hello` endpoint that returns a JSON response.
2. **`test_app.py`**:
   - **Fixture `client`**: The `client` fixture sets up a test client for the Flask app, which can be used to make requests to the application.
     - `app.config['TESTING'] = True`: This enables testing mode in Flask, which provides useful error reporting and disables request warnings.
     - `with app.test_client() as client`: Creates a new instance of the Flask test client.
   - **Test function `test_hello_endpoint`**: This function tests the `/hello` endpoint.
     - `response = client.get('/hello')`: Sends a GET request to the `/hello` endpoint.
     - `assert response.status_code == 200`: Asserts that the response status code is 200 (OK).
     - `assert response.json == {'message': 'Hello, World!'}`: Asserts that the JSON response matches the expected output.

### Running the Tests:

To run the tests, ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`) and then execute the following command in your terminal:

```sh
pytest test_app.py
```

This will run the test suite and verify that the `/hello` endpoint is working as expected.
