Certainly! Below is an example of a `README.md` file for your Flask API project:

```markdown
# Flask API

A simple Flask API with a `/hello` endpoint that returns 'Hello, World!' as JSON.

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.9+**: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed on your system.
2. **Install dependencies**: Use pip to install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```

## Running

1. **Run the app**: Start the Flask application by executing the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. **Access the endpoint**: You can test the `/hello` endpoint using `curl` or any web browser.
    - Using `curl`:
        ```bash
        curl http://localhost:5000/hello
        ```
    - Using a web browser, navigate to:
        ```
        http://localhost:5000/hello
        ```

## Expected Output

When you access the `/hello` endpoint, you should receive the following JSON response:
```json
{
    "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```
```

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that Flask is installed in your environment before running the application.
- The `debug=True` flag in `app.run()` allows for auto-reloading during development and provides detailed error messages. For production, it's recommended to set `debug=False`.
- You can customize the port by passing a `port` argument to `app.run()`, e.g., `app.run(port=8080)`.

This README provides a clear guide on how to set up and run your Flask API with a simple `/hello` endpoint.
